- 👋 Hi, I’m Koushik!
- 👀 I’m interested in Test Automation Engineering, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), API Testing, UI Testing, Software Development, and Cloud Computing. I specialize in Selenium, Cucumber, Java, TestNG, and Node.js for building efficient and scalable test automation frameworks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about AWS Cloud, DevOps Practitioner methodology, advanced automation strategies, AI-driven testing, and continuous integration (CI) best practices. I am also improving my skills in JavaScript and API automation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source test automation projects, improving test frameworks, and innovative testing tools. I enjoy working with teams that focus on creating efficient and high-quality software testing solutions.
